# DeliveryManagement System

Problem Statement #
Careem's vision is to become the biggest mover of people and goods across MENA. In this sphere, a major challenge is around the logistics of delivering shipments to customers. Build a platform that can work with commerce companies who need a shipment delivery service. The platform should be a B2B one where commerce companies will request quotations for their shipments and the platform will look into its transportation resources to find the most cost-effective and reliable way to deliver shipments. The platform will be provided some inputs on different hubs and transportation resources from that for the last mile delivery. For inter-city shipment delivery, the platform can work with partners to deliver the shipments through trains, flights and trucks if required. The partner information will also be part of the input to the platform and is expected to change.
